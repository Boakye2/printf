Project : 0x11. C - printf

Write a function that produces output according to a format.               
    • Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);                     
    • Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte us
ed to end output to strings)                                               
    • write output to stdout, the standard output stream                   
    • format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero o
r more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the
 following conversion specifiers:                                          
        ◦ c                                                                
        ◦ s                                                                
        ◦ %                                                                
    • You don’t have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library prin
tf function                                                                
    • You don’t have to handle the flag characters                         
    • You don’t have to handle field width                                 
    • You don’t have to handle precision                                   
    • You don’t have to handle the length modifiers
